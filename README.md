# Euler vector calculation: A class to calculate and plot Euler vectors of rotation 
This is the code related to the paper "Linear system approach to Euler vector inversion" from Smalley, GÃ³mez, and Bevis.
The only dependency is m_map: https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html

As input, the class can take as first argument:

  a) text file,
  
  b) a matrix with the same format as the file, see below,
  
  c) a folder with json files from Parallel.GAMIT.
  
 A second argument (optional) provides the list of stations to use to 
 determine the vector. Finally, a name for the vector (also optional)
 
 If using a text file, it needs to have the following columns 
  (in order, table headers are ignored):
 stnm   x   y z  n_vel  e_vel    OR
 stnm lat lon 0  n_vel  e_vel    
 
 stnm       : name of the station
 x y z      : meters
 lat lon    : decimal degrees
 n_vel e_vel: meters/year (do NOT use mm/yr)

 The Euler vector will be calculated using all stations or using a subset
 determined by the either a cell array with the stations names
 or another text file with a list of station names.
 The Euler vector is determined using the technique explained in Smalley
 et al. (xxxx) and a robost least squares algorithm 
 that relies on a goodness of fit test to remove outliers. This is why
 you should not use mm/yr instead of m/year. The fit starts with very
 loose weights for each station (equivalent to 1 m/yr) and it reweighs
 the dataset on several iterations removing outliers.

 EXAMPLES:
 using a list of json files from Parallel.GAMIT
   evect = euler_vector('../Solutions', 'href.txt');
 using a text file as input
   evect = euler_vector('sam.dat', 'href.txt');
 or just a single argument to use all the station in the file
   evect = euler_vector('sam.dat');
 the list of sites can also be provided using a cell array
   evect = euler_vector('sam.dat', {'stn1', 'stn2', 'stn3' ...});
 plot the result and histograms of residuals
   evect.plot_result(250);
 to predict a station's velocity, use
   vel = evect.compute_vel(x)
 where x accepts the same inputs as the object
 if the prediction and a plot is desired, then use
   vel = evect.plot_prediction(files, 100, true);
 where 100 is the scale for the velocity vectors, and true determines
 if error ellipses should be plotted or not
